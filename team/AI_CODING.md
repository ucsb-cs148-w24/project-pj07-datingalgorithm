Palvi: 
I used ChatGPT to help write CSS code for the profile creation page. Through this AI tool, I learned key CSS elements, how to format, and create a better UI design. 
Although this tool was useful and I will most likely use it again, I plan on exploring other AI tools to better our project. To ensure that the code produced by ChatGPT was correct,
I tested it on my local machine before confirming it was fair to use (if it worked as intended, then I pushed it to our GitHub).

I used Codeium to help me write the unit test code for the ChatScreen page. I ran the test code he gave me on my computer and it successfully ran my web page. It successfully displays the user's chat information. At the same time, I also used ChatGPT to help me complete the CSS file. It makes my pages more complete and beautiful.

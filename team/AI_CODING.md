Palvi: 
I used ChatGPT to help write CSS code for the profile creation page. Through this AI tool, I learned key CSS elements, how to format, and create a better UI design. 
Although this tool was useful and I will most likely use it again, I plan on exploring other AI tools to better our project. To ensure that the code produced by ChatGPT was correct,
I tested it on my local machine before confirming it was fair to use (if it worked as intended, then I pushed it to our GitHub).

Xinyan:
I used Codeium to help me write the unit test code for the ChatScreen page. I ran the test code he gave me on my computer and it successfully ran my web page. It successfully displays the user's chat information. At the same time, I also used ChatGPT to help me complete the CSS file. It makes my pages more complete and beautiful.

I used Vercel v0.dev to generate code that allows me to customize the button to upload images, making the look of the profile page more refined. The tool seems pretty useful especially since it helped me in coding ways to make the page look more put together. What's even better is that if the feature I'm adding isn't what I want it to look like, I can make a few adjustments since the framework for what I wanted is there already. The only thing is that you have to make sure the code is correct or fits into your code by testing it out.

Vedant:
I used Codeium to write test cases for the swipingScreen page. We've been having issues with pulling dat from firebase, so being able to write test cases has been very helpful. I was very amazed by how it's able to read through the entire codebase in order to generate the best code possible. I plan on continuing to use to generate many more unit tests.
I also used chat GPT to generate CSS code for the swipe screen. As someone without much expirience with CSS, it's a very useful tool to have.

I used Cursor to fix the unit test code the App.test.js file. It properly gave setup the configuration code for jest and helped fix the issue. 

Emre:
I used Vercel's v0.dev to create new UI designs for our project. After getting the designs I liked I used ChatGPT to help me integrate these design to our existing project. There were a lot of errors but it was great how it looked in the end. 

Koray: Emre and I used ChatGPT to produce a good-looking background image for our home screen. I also used Vercel v0.dev to explore how we can improve the overall UI of our project. I'm planning to keep using Vercel v0.dev to improve the visuality of our profile creation page and swiping page, and we're considering potentially changing how the home screen looks as well.

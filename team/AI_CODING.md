Palvi: 
I used ChatGPT to help write CSS code for the profile creation page. Through this AI tool, I learned key CSS elements, how to format, and create a better UI design. 
Although this tool was useful and I will most likely use it again, I plan on exploring other AI tools to better our project. To ensure that the code produced by ChatGPT was correct,
I tested it on my local machine before confirming it was fair to use (if it worked as intended, then I pushed it to our GitHub).

I used Codeium to help me write the unit test code for the ChatScreen page. I ran the test code he gave me on my computer and it successfully ran my web page. It successfully displays the user's chat information. At the same time, I also used ChatGPT to help me complete the CSS file. It makes my pages more complete and beautiful.

I used Vercel v0.dev to generate code that allows me to customize the button to upload images, making the look of the profile page more refined. The tool seems pretty useful especially since it helped me in coding ways to make the page look more put together. What's even better is that if the feature I'm adding isn't what I want it to look like, I can make a few adjustments since the framework for what I wanted is there already. The only thing is that you have to make sure the code is correct or fits into your code by testing it out.

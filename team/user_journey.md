Lab01 - User Journey

1. What is the user's goal, need or desire?
The user's desire is to find a valuable connection with someone and eventually form a relationship with them. With our app, we plan to create a personalized pool of people for our users to select from. 

2. What is the series of events, in chronological order?
The user is looking for a relationship and is tired of using other dating apps. They stumble upon our app and are intrigued by the "blind" dating feature of our matchmaking service. The user is tired of looking through a large pool of people, talking to them, and then figuring out if they are a good match. 


As a single looking for love, I can access a personalized pool of people to form a relationship with so that I can save time on searching for a potential match.

## Action Item
    Goal: communicate more professionally	
    Experiment: stop texting and use Slack more
    Measurement: the amount of notifications we are getting on Slack
    
    Goal: We continue doing more pull requests
    Experiment: We should only have pushes to the main if we're doing small edits. Everything else is done through pull requests
    Measurement: Count how many closed pull requests we have


## Retro Assessment
For our retro, we used the start/stop/continue method to figure out what has been working for our team and what we should change. Then, as a team, we discussed which items we felt were most important and created a plan to address these issues.

Our retro went very well and we heard lots of useful advice on how we can improve our development process as well as entering the last week of the class. After our discussion, we decided on experiments to fix these issues during our next sprint cycle.

I would recommend the next person leading a retro to only listen and remain neutral the entire time. It is difficult to avoid voicing your opinion; however, it is very beneficial for the team to approach the issues from a neutral perspective.


## Experiment/Change
One of our experiments was to discuss tickets more and try updating the Kanban board more. This experiment went really well as it showed other group members how each part of the project was going. We will continue doing this.

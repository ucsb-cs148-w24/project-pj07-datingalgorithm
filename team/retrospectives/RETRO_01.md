## Retro Assessment
We used the start/stop/continue method to figure out some things that people wanted us to change on continue doing. We then voted on which things were most important, and decided to make a plan to address these things.

It went very well. We heard lots of useful advice on how we can improve our development process. We created expiriements to try to fix the issues during our next sprint.

I would reccomend the next person leading a retro to only listen and remain nuetral the entire time. It is difficult to avoid voicing your opinion; however, it is very beneficial for the team to approach the issues from a nuetral perspective.

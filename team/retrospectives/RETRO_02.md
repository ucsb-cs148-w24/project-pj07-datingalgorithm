## Retro Assessment
For our retro, we used the start/stop/continue method to figure out what has been working for our team and what we should change. Then, as a team, we discussed which items we felt were most important and created a plan to address these issues. 

Our retro went very well and we heard lots of useful advice on how we can improve our development process. After our discussion, we decided on experiments to fix these issues during our next sprint cycle. 

I would recommend the next person leading a retro to only listen and remain neutral the entire time. It is difficult to avoid voicing your opinion; however, it is very beneficial for the team to approach the issues from a neutral perspective.

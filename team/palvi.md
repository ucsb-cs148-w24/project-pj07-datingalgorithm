Project Team #7 - Dating App

Dating App Ideas:

“Blind” Dating: the user reads the profile of other users in their pool first and if they like their personality based on profile, then the user gets to look at their picture; this is supposed to encourage the user to actually build an interest with other people through their profiles (which includes a questionarre) before actually seeeing how they look

Matchmaking Service: the pool of people a user can select from are people that are narrowed down based on future goals, personal interests, family plans, relationship goals, etc.; instead of the user searching through a wde pool of people and then talking to them to figure out if its a match, our app will select a pool of people for the user based on categories (part of the matchmaking questionarre)

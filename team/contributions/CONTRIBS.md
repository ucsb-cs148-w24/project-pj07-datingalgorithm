## Vedant Shah
I wrote the code and designed the entire Swipe Screen. My code displayed the cards in a presentable mannor, made sure users woulnd't see users they already swiped right on, and correctly moved swiped users through the correct pipeline in Github(liked user -> new match -> match).

I also created the user profiles as well as the new Matches bar within the chart page.

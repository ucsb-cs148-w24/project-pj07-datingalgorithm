I wrote the code and designed the entire Swipe Screen. My code displayed the cards in a presentable mannor, made sure users woulnd't see users they already swiped right on, and correctly moved swiped users through the correct pipeline in Github(liked user -> new match -> match).

I also created the user profiles as well as the new Matches bar within the chart page.

I designed the welcoming home screen with the project name, and the motto and built the sign-in button and the code that only accepts UCSB students to the app. Helped others with their problems too.
